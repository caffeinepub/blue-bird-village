      "featureTitle": "Increase the visual prominence and visibility of all interactive buttons in the game UI — including the mute/unmute music button in GameHUD.tsx, the TouchControls action buttons (yellow jump, green music, pink hints), and the BlockHotbar slot buttons. Buttons must have clearly legible labels/icons, stronger contrast against the background, a visible border or raised effect, and a hover/active press state (e.g., brightness change or scale). All styling must remain consistent with the existing Minecraft pixel-art theme (Press Start 2P font, earthy/blocky flat UI, stone/earthy color palette).",
