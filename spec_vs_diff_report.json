  "summary": "The diff implements the core requirements of a Minecraft-style village game with a blue bird character using React Three Fiber. All five requirements are substantially addressed: the 3D village scene (REQ-1), the blue bird character with controls (REQ-2), a follow camera (REQ-3), HUD with mute/unmute and position display (REQ-4), and Minecraft pixel-art UI theme (REQ-5). However, the camera does not rotate with the bird's movement direction as specified in REQ-3, and the terrain only uses a single grass-dirt texture rather than distinctly showing grass, dirt, AND stone blocks as separate voxel types.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Blocky terrain must include grass, dirt, AND stone blocks as distinct voxel types",
      "reason": "The Terrain component renders a uniform 32x32 grid using a single grass-dirt texture with no separate stone block layers or distinct dirt sub-layers. No stone blocks appear in the terrain itself.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Camera should rotate with the bird's movement direction",
      "reason": "FollowCamera uses a fixed world-space OFFSET (0, 6, 11) added to the bird's position regardless of facing direction. The camera does not rotate to stay behind the bird relative to its facing angle.",
