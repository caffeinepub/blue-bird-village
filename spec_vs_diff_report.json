  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-16 across all three target files (GameHUD.tsx, TouchControls.tsx, BlockHotbar.tsx) and supporting CSS (index.css). All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed: the mute button has distinct background/border/padding, touch action buttons use mc-action-btn with bevel borders and high-contrast icons, hotbar slots have visible borders with highlighted active state, hover/active states are defined in CSS, and the Minecraft pixel-art theme is maintained throughout.",
